I have been creating websites for a long time. In third grade I touched HTML for the first time; there was a week-long after-school program that culminated in writing a page that was sent to sitting president at the time, George Bush. I wish I had access to it now, I would love to see it.

The digital landscape of web development is constantly evolving, and it's challenging to keep up with the newest trends. The latest and greatest web development frameworks and technologies emerge all the time, and it's tough to decide which one to use.

For those of us who enjoy creating websites as a hobby, it can be difficult to find a sustainable model for keeping up to date with the newest trends. As we all know, web development is not a one-time project, but rather a continuous process that requires regular updates and maintenance. It's essential to keep up with the latest technologies and frameworks to create a website that is both modern and functional.

While it's crucial to stay up to date with the latest web development trends, reducing friction when updating a personal website is equally important. As a web developer, I don't want to spend hours on end updating and maintaining my website. I want a simple, intuitive system that allows me to make changes quickly and easily.

That's where TinaCMS comes in. TinaCMS is a powerful content management system (CMS) that allows me to make changes to my website's content quickly and efficiently. It's a lightweight and flexible system that is easy to use and requires minimal setup time.

With TinaCMS, I can update my website's content without touching the underlying code. It's a fantastic tool that makes updating my website a breeze. I can easily add new pages, edit existing ones, and even upload images and videos without any coding knowledge.
