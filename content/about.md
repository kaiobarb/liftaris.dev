# About Me

##### Kaio Barbosa-Chifan

##### (Kye-o bar-Bow-suh key-Fawn)

I am a programmer and artist. \
I like to make games, dabble in many things at once, and be chill.

I was born in California, grew up in Natal, Brazil, returning to California at age 15. I studied Computer Science at the beautiful campus of UC Santa Cruz.

In the past I have traveled a decent amount, and lived in a few different countries, but in June 2021 I settled in Seattle where I live with my wife. I like to go on meandering walks, cook good food, and spend time climbing at the local bouldering gym.
