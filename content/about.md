# About Me

##### Kaio Barbosa-Chifan

##### (Kai-o bar-Bow-suh key-Fawn)

\
I have an interest in programming as a whole, I get paid for web dev, and I can't seem to shake off the idea of making games for fun.

I was born in California, and grew up in Natal, Brazil, returning to California at age 15. I studied Computer Science at the beautiful campus of UC Santa Cruz.

In the past I have traveled a decent amount, and have lived in a few different countries, but in June 2021 I settled in Seattle where I live with my wife.
